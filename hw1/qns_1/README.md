The following image illustrates the empirical distribution
of the dataset. The x-axis indicates the class index and the y-axis
indicates the empirical probability of that class index.

The following image illustrates the performance of the
trained model. We can see that we have managed to fit the
true empirical distribution. The learnt probability for each
class matches the empirical distribution. If we sample from the model,
the empirical distribution of the sampled dataset roughly
matches the empirical distribution of the true dataset.
